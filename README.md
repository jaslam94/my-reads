# My Reads (MERN app)

Use [My Reads](https://my-reads-mern.herokuapp.com/) to bookmark the list of books you like or want to read.

I have made this project to learn MERN stack development. Hence, I am actively seeking code reviews and contributions.

Make a PR if you want to make it better.

The app is deployed on Heroku and the database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

**Note:** This app is for learning purposes and not for any commerical use.
